# Breed Premium Review - Australian Cattle Market

## Baseline Concept
**"Cross Breed" = 0%** is our baseline (average market price)
- All other breeds are premium or discount relative to Cross Breed
- Premiums based on: meat quality, market demand, genetic value, climate suitability

## BREEDING CATTLE (Breeding Cow, Breeder)
Used for breeding programs - premiums reflect genetic value and breeding characteristics

| Breed | Current % | Proposed % | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **PREMIUM BREEDS** |
| Angus | 28% | 28% | Gold standard for meat quality, marbling, temperament |

| Santa Gertrudis | 12% | 12% | (Brahman X Shorthorn) Good for harsh climates |
| Charbray | 12% | 12% | (Charolais X Brahman) Size + adaptation |
| **DAIRY/DUAL PURPOSE** |
| Friesian | 8% | 5% | Dairy breed, lower meat quality but good milk |
| Friesian Cross | 8% | 5% | Mixed dairy genetics |
| Holstein | ? | 5% | Similar to Friesian |
| **BASELINE** |
| Cross Breed | 15% | **0%** | **THIS SHOULD BE BASELINE** |
| European Cross | 15% | 0% | Generic European mix |
| Mixed Breed | ? | 0% | Unknown genetics = baseline |

## STEERS (Grown Steer, Yearling Steer, Weaner Steer, Feeder Steer)
Used for meat production - premiums reflect meat quality and growth

| Breed | Current % | Proposed % | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **PREMIUM BREEDS** |
| Angus | 28% | 28% | Highest marbling, best eating quality |
| Red Angus | 28% | 28% | Same as Angus |
| Black Angus | 28% | 28% | Same as Angus |
| Wagyu | 28% | 40% | **EXTREME** marbling, export premium |
| **PREMIUM CROSSBREEDS** |
| Angus X Friesian | 20% | 20% | Good size + quality |
| Charolais X Angus | 20% | 22% | Excellent meat yield |
| Black Baldy | 20% | 18% | Consistent quality |
| **EUROPEAN BREEDS** |
| Charolais | ? | 15% | Excellent muscling, lean |
| Limousin | ? | 12% | Lean, high yield |
| Hereford | ? | 8% | Traditional beef |
| Simmental | ? | 10% | Large frame, good growth |
| Shorthorn | ? | 6% | Older genetics |
| **TROPICAL BREEDS** |
| Brahman | 12% | 8% | Lower quality meat but valuable in north |
| Droughtmaster | 12% | 12% | Better meat than pure Brahman |
| Brangus | 12% | 18% | Good meat + hardiness |
| **BASELINE** |
| Cross Breed | 15% | **0%** | Average market steer |

## HEIFERS
Young females - premiums for breeding potential + meat

| Breed | Proposed % | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Angus | 28% | Breeding + meat value |
| Wagyu | 35% | Breeding program value |
| Charolais X Angus | 22% | Good crossbreeding prospect |
| Brangus | 18% | Versatile genetics |
| Hereford | 10% | Classic breeding |
| Droughtmaster | 15% | Tropical breeding value |
| **Cross Breed** | **0%** | Baseline |

---

## CULL/DRY COWS (Dry Cow, Cull Cow)
End of breeding life - lower premiums (mainly meat value)

| Breed | Proposed % | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Angus | 20% | Still good meat quality |
| Wagyu | 25% | Premium even as cull |
| Brahman | 5% | Lower meat quality |
| Droughtmaster | 8% | Decent meat |
| Friesian | 0% | Dairy cull = low value |
| **Cross Breed** | **0%** | Baseline cull cow |

---

## BULLS (Grown Bull, Yearling Bull, Weaner Bull)
Breeding stock - HIGHEST premiums for genetics

| Breed | Proposed % | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Angus | 40% | Proven genetics, high demand |
| Wagyu | 60% | Extreme breeding value |
| Charolais | 25% | Good growth genetics |
| Brahman | 20% | Tropical breeding value |
| **Cross Breed** | **0%** | Baseline bull |

## KEY RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Set "Cross Breed" to 0% (Baseline)
Currently it's at 15% - this should be our reference point

### 2. Adjust Wagyu Higher
Wagyu should be 35-60% depending on category (it's currently same as Angus at 28%)

### 3. Add Negative Premiums
Some breeds like dairy culls should be -5% to 0%

### 4. Regional Variations (Future)
- Northern saleyards: Brahman/Droughtmaster +5% bonus
- Southern saleyards: European breeds +5% bonus

## MISSING BREEDS TO ADD

- Speckle Park (+15%)
- Belted Galloway (+12%)
- Devon (+8%)
- Square Meaters (+10%)
- Lowline Angus (+22%)
- Senepol (+12%)
- Gelbvieh (+10%)

## REVIEW QUESTIONS FOR YOU:
1. Should we set Cross Breed = 0% as baseline?
2. Should Wagyu be higher than Angus?
3. Are tropical breeds (Brahman/Droughtmaster) valued correctly for your market?
4. Do you want negative premiums for dairy culls?
5. Should bulls have higher premiums than cows of same breed?
