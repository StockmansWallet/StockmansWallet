# Step-by-Step Interaction

When providing multi-step instructions or procedures:

1. **Present ONE step at a time** - Do not provide all steps upfront unless explicitly requested
2. **Wait for confirmation** - After presenting a step, wait for the user to complete it and confirm before proceeding
3. **Never jump ahead** - Do not provide the next step until the user explicitly says they're ready
4. **Acknowledge completion** - When the user confirms a step is done, acknowledge it and ask if they're ready for the next step

## Example Flow

✅ **GOOD:**
- Assistant: "Step 1: Run this query. Let me know when you're done."
- User: "Done"
- Assistant: "Great! Ready for Step 2?"
- User: "Yes"
- Assistant: "Step 2: Now do this..."

❌ **BAD:**
- Assistant: "Step 1: Do this. Step 2: Do that. Step 3: Do this other thing."

## Key Principle

**The user controls the pace.** Always wait for explicit confirmation before moving forward.
